In 1985 the company was re-named Quantum Computer Services and was the first online service launched for the Commodore 64 and 128 consoles. In 1988, the company created an online service for the PC and changed its name to AOL America Online, becoming over the next decade the premier Online access subscription business, at one point having almost 25MM subscribers. AOL originally went public in 1992 and grew to become the largest online access and portal company on the Web. In 2000, AOL acquired Time Warner for $160B+ in what was then considered to be the largest M&A transaction, and the company was re-named AOL Time Warner. The merger was not fruitful and on May 28, 2009, Time Warner announced that it would spin off AOL into a separate public company. The spinoff occurred on December 9, 2009, ending the eight-year relationship between the two companies.Since then, AOL has focused on reinventing itself as a brand company under the guidance of CEO Tim Armstrong, creating and acquiring a range of content properties. Major acquisitions include the purchase of technology news blog TechCrunch in September 2010, and on March 7, 2011, the purchase of The Huffington Post.

It was a huge hit: in 2 weeks, half of the schools in the Boston area began demanding a Facebook network. Zuckerberg immediately recruited his friends Dustin Moskovitz, Chris Hughes, and Eduardo Saverin to help build Facebook, and within four months, Facebook added 30 more college networks.The original idea for the term Facebook came from Zuckerberg’s high school Phillips Exeter Academy. The Exeter Face Book was passed around to every student as a way for students to get to know their classmates for the following year. It was a physical paper book until Zuckerberg brought it to the internet.With this success, Zuckerberg, Moskowitz and Hughes moved out to Palo Alto for the summer and rented a sublet. A few weeks later, Zuckerberg ran into the former cofounder of Napster, Sean Parker Parker soon moved in to Zuckerberg’s apartment and they began working together. Parker provided the introduction to their first investor, Peter Thiel, cofounder of PayPal and managing partner of The Founders Fund. Thiel invested $500,000 into Facebook.With millions more users, Friendster attempted to acquire the company for $10 million in mid 2004. Facebook turned down the offer and subsequently received $12.7 million in funding from Accel Partners, at a valuation of around $100 million Facebook continued to grow, opening up to high school students in September 2005 and adding an immensely popular photo sharing feature the next month. The next spring, Facebook received $25 million in funding from Greylock Partners and Meritech Capital, as well as previous investors Accel Partners and Peter Thiel. The pre-money valuation for this deal was about $525 million. Facebook subsequently opened up to work networks, eventually amassing over 20,000 work networks. Finally in September 2006, Facebook opened to anyone with an email address.In the summer of 2006, Yahoo attempted to acquire the company for $1 billion dollars. Reports actually indicated that Zuckerberg made a verbal agreement to sell Facebook to Yahoo. A few days later when Yahoo’s stock price took a dive, the offer was lowered to $800 million and Zuckerberg walked away from the deal. Yahoo later offered $1 billion again, this time Zuckerberg turned Yahoo down and earned instant notoriety as the “kid” who turned down a billion. This was not the first time Zuckerberg turned down an acquisition offer; Viacom had previously unsuccessfully attempted to acquire the company for $750 million in March 2006.Not long after, in October 2007, Microsoft invested $240 million into Facebook for 1.6 percent of the company in. This meant a valuation of over $15 billion, making Facebook the 5th most valuable US Internet company, yet with only $150 million in annual revenue. Many explained Microsoft’s decision as being solely driven by the desire to outbid Google continued to receive funding, most notably in January 2011 receiving a $1.5 billion round, valuing the company at $50 billion. A year later, in February 2012, Facebook announced that it was filing for its long-anticipated initial public offering. The company went public on May 18, 2012, opening on the NASDAQ with shares trading at $42.05 sour note for Facebook has been the controversy with social network ConnectU. The founders of ConnectU, former classmates of Mark Zuckerberg at Harvard, allege that Zuckerberg stole their original source code for Facebook. The ordeal has gone to court, and has now been resolved this lingering controversy, Facebook’s growth has been staggering. Facebook announced astonishing numbers in February 2012 upon filing for its IPO. As of July 2013, over 1.15 billion users log into Facebook every month, and 669 million users log in daily. Mobile users now make up half of Facebook’s user base, with 819 million monthly actives. Facebook has also announced that by the end of 2011 there had been 100 billion friend connections, and in recent months users had been registering 2.7 billion Likes and Comments per day. Facebook is one of the most trafficked sites in the US, and its international growth has been impressive. Additionally, Facebook is the top photo sharing site with 250 million photos uploaded per day.Facebook users’ passion—or addiction—to the site is unparalleled: more than half use the product every single day and users spend an average of 19 minutes a day on Facebook. The site’s popularity has garnered it pop culture fame, so much so that in 2010 a feature film entitled The Social Network was released which chronicled Facebook’s inception.In its 2012 IPO filing, Facebook announced that it intends to grow in the near future by expanding its global user base, increasing engagement by developing new social tools, improving the mobile experience, and creating more value for advertisers and users.",http://facebook.com,http://twitter.com/facebook,"Atlas Advertiser Suite, Beluga, Bolt | Peters, Branch, Chai Labs, Digital Staircase, Divvyshot, drop.io, Face.com, Friend.ly, FriendFeed, GazeHawk, Glancee, Gowalla, Hot Potato, Instagram, Jibbigo, Karma, Lightbox, Little Eye Labs, LiveRail, Monoidics, Nextstop, Octazen Solutions, Oculus VR, Onavo, Osmeta, Parakey, Parse, PrivateCore, ProtoGeo, Pryte, Pursuit, Push Pop Press, Rel8tion, Sendoid, ShareGrove, Snaptu, Sofa, Spaceport.io, Spool, SportStream, Storylane, Strobe, Tagtile, threadsy, WhatsApp, WhoGlue, Zenbe","Facebook acquired Atlas Advertiser Suite in 2013, Facebook acquired Beluga in 2011, Facebook acquired Bolt | Peters in 2012, Facebook acquired Branch in 2014, Facebook acquired Chai Labs in 2010, Facebook acquired Digital Staircase in 2011, Facebook acquired Divvyshot in 2010, Facebook acquired drop.io in 2010, Facebook acquired Face.com in 2012, Facebook acquired Friend.ly in 2012, Facebook acquired FriendFeed in 2009, Facebook acquired GazeHawk in 2012, Facebook acquired Glancee in 2012, Facebook acquired Gowalla in 2011, Facebook acquired Hot Potato in 2010, Facebook acquired Instagram in 2012, Facebook acquired Jibbigo in 2013, Facebook acquired Karma in 2012, Facebook acquired Lightbox in 2012, Facebook acquired Little Eye Labs in 2014, Facebook acquired LiveRail in 2014, Facebook acquired Monoidics in 2013, Facebook acquired Nextstop in 2010, Facebook acquired Octazen Solutions in 2010, Facebook acquired Oculus VR in 2014, Facebook acquired Onavo in 2013, Facebook acquired Osmeta in 2013, Facebook acquired Parakey in 2007, Facebook acquired Parse in 2013, Facebook acquired PrivateCore in 2014, Facebook acquired ProtoGeo in 2014, Facebook acquired Pryte in 2014, Facebook acquired Pursuit in 2011, Facebook acquired Push Pop Press in 2011, Facebook acquired Rel8tion in 2011, Facebook acquired Sendoid in 2012, Facebook acquired ShareGrove in 2010, Facebook acquired Snaptu in 2011, Facebook acquired Sofa in 2011, Facebook acquired Spaceport.io in 2013, Facebook acquired Spool in 2012, Facebook acquired SportStream in 2013, Facebook acquired Storylane in 2013, Facebook acquired Strobe in 2011, Facebook acquired Tagtile in 2012, Facebook acquired threadsy in 2012, Facebook acquired WhatsApp in 2014, Facebook acquired WhoGlue in 2011, Facebook acquired Zenbe in 2010",http://api.crunchbase.com/v/2/organization/facebook?user_key=0ebdc8274e821149894a240090945265

Terman was considered a mentor to them in forming Hewlett-Packard. In 1939, Packard and Hewlett established Hewlett-Packard HP in Packard's garage with an initial capital investment of US$538.
